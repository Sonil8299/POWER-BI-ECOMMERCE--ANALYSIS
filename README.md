# POWER-BI-ECOMMERCE--ANALYSIS
Analysis using POWER BI
Power BI project - an "E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to explore the vast potential of Power BI and its ability to transform raw data into actionable insights.
The dashboard showcases a comprehensive set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that offer valuable business insights, including Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Quantity, and Total Shipping Cost. Additionally, it provides a detailed breakdown of sales by Category, Market, and Shipping Mode, among other insightful metrics.
